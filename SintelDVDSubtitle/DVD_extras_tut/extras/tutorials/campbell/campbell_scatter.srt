1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:03,176
In some areas of the city

2
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:05,849
we want it to look like to be slum that have the junk everywhere

3
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:07,654
so rather than placing them manually

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,128
we are using physics scattered and found that would be a nice tool

5
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:13,618
that would be able to draw into the scene with grease pencil

6
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:15,995
and it will find the areas you would want the junk to go

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,851
and then use the script to place it

8
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:21,593
Er...

9
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,449
So I've got a group of objects here

10
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:29,420
of junk objects that are of the appeal

11
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:30,162
they are just proxy objects

12
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:33,133
you know really it would look good

13
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:34,275
alright

14
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:35,875
by the lines there the script...

15
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:39,017
It is working in progress and it doesn't do properly stacking

16
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:40,331
but it's quite quick

17
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:44,615
and it feels to me wagons' there I'm not sure about that 

18
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,300
we can place them manually but that's hmm... What I've got so far

19
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:53,184
so far it is not quite rough and doesn't do proper intersections

20
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:56,840
We may add that later

21
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:59,068
use bullet or something like that

22
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,820
or you might just place it manually

23
00:01:00,782 --> 00:01:04,533
because it is easily duplicate faces so we translate objects on the top of face

24
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:09,580
made it smoother so you can see the objects rather than the face getting in the way

25
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:15,616
but we can place them using snapping just kinda of what you can

26
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:20,662
OK use the face scale tool

27
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:23,100
so you gotta watch it

28
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:33,630
OK

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
