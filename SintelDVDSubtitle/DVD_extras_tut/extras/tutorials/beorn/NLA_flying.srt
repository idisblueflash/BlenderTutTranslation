00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,361
this is a short tutorial explaining how we made the varies of things like fly for our movie "Sintel"

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,778
we have basicly dragons, butterflies, birds

3
00:00:11,906 --> 00:00:13,922
then a large amount of them

4
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:19,122
so we have to carry out with an enfficent way of making a fly in an interesting way

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,774
and for this

6
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:24,045
we use a library of cycles

7
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,868
this one is a bird cycle I come up with

8
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:33,256
it's also one for the baby dragon and for the butterfly

9
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:41,491
for example here is the baby dragon and you will this is the baby dragon with cycles in the character directory

10
00:00:41,512 --> 00:00:47,115
btw, in the action list you will find different varies of ones

11
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:54,989
so anyway here is a small example about a bird flying around the bezier spline

12
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:59,827
you'll see the banking somewhere you wanna go around it such as connection

13
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:03,287
what you normally do is in the NLA

14
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:07,489
import this cycle you saw earlier

15
00:01:07,574 --> 00:01:09,760
and simply go down

16
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:14,217
and increase the number of Repeats such as the beziered animation

17
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:17,655
and there have a bird flying around the spline

18
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,159
unfortunately it looks wrapped out

19
00:01:20,117 --> 00:01:22,515
because the fly's waven

20
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:24,552
and I really have much characters to do

21
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:29,582
and I don't have anything to do with speeding up or slowing down

22
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:30,898
as is the part changes

23
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:33,233
so I don't wanna change it and I would use these two buttons

24
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:37,116
one of these is the new feature for this candidates started for Durian

25
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:44,714
Basically it means that we now have the use of a F-Curve we have controls over the timing in the NLA strip

26
00:01:44,714 --> 00:01:48,959
so basically here you can see

27
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,251
change the handle to vector

28
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,771
here you can see it's looping just as it normally would if you would repeat

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,255
the cycle is in a standard wide

30
00:01:58,191 --> 00:02:00,992
but because of the curve we now have control library

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:08,633
so by adding keyframes I can, for example, make the bird speed up as it goes around the curve

32
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:10,097
so add a keyframe here

33
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:11,816
and keyframe here

34
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:14,809
select to the end and lift them up

35
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,568
you now see in that region it will speed the curve

36
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:22,619
which means that the bird will fly faster in that region

37
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:27,394
now just set another one here and drag it up again

38
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:32,742
so basically the speedy curve means a faster flap a shadowed curve means a slower flap

39
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:36,902
as you can see this means that the bird now has a provisional appeal

40
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:44,521
and you can make the flap speed make sense to the projectory of the bird

41
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:45,582
so alright

42
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,450
this is the technique used

43
00:02:47,513 --> 00:02:50,845
and hopefully you can find it useful for other themes

44
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:51,758
good luck

45
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:53,456
see you
