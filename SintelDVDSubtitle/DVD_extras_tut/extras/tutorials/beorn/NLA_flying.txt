this is a short tutorial explaining how we made the varies of things like fly for our movie "Sintel"
we have basicly dragons, butterflies, birds
then a large amount of them
so we have to carry out with an enfficent way of making a fly in an interesting way
and for this
we use a library of cycles
this one is a bird cycle I come up with
it's also one for the baby dragon and for the butterfly
for example here is the baby dragon and you will this is the baby dragon with cycles in the character directory
btw, in the action list you will find different varies of ones
so anyway here is a small example about a bird flying around the bezier spline
you'll see the banking somewhere you wanna go around it such as connection
what you normally do is in the NLA
import this cycle you saw earlier
and simply go down
and increase the number of Repeats such as the beziered animation
and there have a bird flying around the spline
unfortunately it looks wrapped out
because the fly's waven
and I really have much characters to do
and I don't have anything to do with speeding up or slowing down
as is the part changes
so I don't wanna change it and I would use these two buttons
one of these is the new feature for this candidates started for Durian
Basically it means that we now have the use of a F-Curve we have controls over the timing in the NLA strip
so basically here you can see
change the handle to vector
here you can see it's looping just as it normally would if you would repeat
the cycle is in a standard wide
but because of the curve we now have control library
so by adding keyframes I can, for example, make the bird speed up as it goes around the curve
so add a keyframe here
and keyframe here
select to the end and lift them up
you now see in that region it will speed the curve
which means that the bird will fly faster in that region
now just set another one here and drag it up again
so basically the speedy curve means a faster flap a shadowed curve means a slower flap
as you can see this means that the bird now has a provisional appeal
and you can make the flap speed make sense to the projectory of the bird
so alright
this is the technique used
and hopefully you can find it useful for other themes
good luck
see you
