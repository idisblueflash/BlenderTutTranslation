1
00:00:03,177 --> 00:00:04,919
For each Sintel

2
00:00:04,976 --> 00:00:06,182
start with the young Sintel

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,326
and all her shape keys

4
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:26,165
I then simply added one aging shape key and named it "sintel_scene8"

5
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:39,368
this aging shape key was also added to her shirt, 

6
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:42,844
inside mouth, 

7
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:51,480
eyebrow emit, top and bottom eyelash emit as well as her tear line

8
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,680
when left on

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,661
the shape fits into all the rest of the shapes which alters the model

10
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:23,395
I then went back to check out all existing facial shapes held up

11
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:38,804
they all worked well so we left as is

12
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,498
since the aging shape is on the slider

13
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:49,580
the range can be adjusted to any desired value for the movie

14
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:55,935
overwriting the full value of the shape even further or age her even more
