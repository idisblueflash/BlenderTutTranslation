00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Hi I'm Angela Guenette

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:06,304
and I'm going to talk about some of the work I did on the film Sintel

3
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:11,294
These are the same techniques I've used working in Maya, Softimage XSI

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,718
On productions such as the featured film "Everyone's Hero"

5
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:17,208
and the DVD movie "Barbie as Rapunzel"

6
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:20,048
and the television "Spider-man: The New Animated Series"

7
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:21,489
As I demonstrate

8
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:23,482
these techniques work really well in blender

9
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:27,204
In this first part

10
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:31,931
we are going to look at how I organize facial topology specifically for animation use

11
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:41,385
the vertical span in the center of the face separates the left and right side

12
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,028
for the eye area

13
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:45,143
the vertical span ran across the pupil

14
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:49,677
matching the up eyelid center to the bottom eyelid center

15
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:54,567
as the same center line also divides the inner eyebrow and the outer eyebrow

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,235
for the other corners of the mouth

17
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:59,261
we have three holes onto spans

18
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:00,236
the center span

19
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:02,616
which divides upper and lower portion

20
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:05,311
and two supporting span on either side

21
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:09,001
the eye area is also organized in same way as the mouth

22
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:12,681
with center span and two supporting spans on either side

23
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:18,951
the eyebrow location is clearly defined by two parallel spans

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,797
encircling the eye area is a mask like continued span

25
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:27,152
nose and mouth area are also contained together

26
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:30,727
this defined the upper and lower portion of the face

27
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:33,403
using extrude select

28
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:37,628
you can see how the lip line is defined by two parallel loops

29
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:38,651
for the luff line

30
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:42,579
we have a central loop with two supporting loops

31
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:46,909
and the crease of eyelids are also defined in this way

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,287
taking a closer look in 3 quarter of view

33
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:57,700
you can see how the three parallel spans meet at the top, middle and bottom edge of nostril

34
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:00,864
the middle span is used to create the crease

35
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:05,366
also in wireframe they should look like luff lines

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:15,173
additional spans are used to continue the smooth transition inside the mouth and eye-socks

37
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:23,441
here I'm using Ctrl and Numpad Plus key to increase my selection

38
00:02:23,584 --> 00:02:31,164
building your geometry like this with continued edge loops made it very easy to select areas of the face when working with your model

39
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:50,835
here you can see closely how the top lip and bottom lip mirror each other

40
00:02:57,115 --> 00:02:57,354
also

41
00:02:57,373 --> 00:03:00,785
vertical spans from top to bottom lineup

42
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,318
taking a closer look at the eyelids

43
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,667
you can see how the topology is organized in the same way as the mouth

44
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,949
the outer edge of the eyelids are also defined by two spans

45
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,635
which are highlighted here in grey color

46
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:33,178
the next span in fits the eyeball creating a shelf

47
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:35,721
or the thickness of the eyelid

48
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:43,616
adding a two-line geometry is a very effective way to add life to the eyes

49
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,429
to make this

50
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:48,061
I simply duplicate the eyelid shelf and then reshaped it

51
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:51,072
creating a slide curve that will catch the light better

52
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,725
the cornea is the glossy transparent part increasing the eye

53
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:04,310
when shaping the eyelids I leave the cornea in solid display

54
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:08,047
which ensures the proper fit without gaps or intersection

55
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:32,354
OK

56
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:35,202
let's hide the proxy here to display the scalp

57
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:41,406
in the property panel under materials

58
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:46,395
you can see how I've divided aparts of the topology with individual material colors

59
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:52,312
the grey topology material clearly displays placement for the hair and eyebrows

60
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:56,642
it also helps to define where the scalp will end and the forehead begin

61
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:02,921
now let's select the "topology_lashline" material

62
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,123
this defines where the eyelashes will be

63
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:17,546
after having these three areas clearly marked

64
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:22,057
I simply duplicate the mesh to create these particle emitter meshes

65
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:53,772
to conclude the section on facial topology

66
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:57,700
let's bring in the shaman and dragon baby beside Sintel to compare

67
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,191
as you can see here

68
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:02,699
although they each have their own tailor-made topology

69
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:05,194
from old man to young girl to creature

70
00:06:05,261 --> 00:06:08,367
the inner structure closely follows the same principles 

71
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:11,999
which pretty much ends up in pre-assembling the muscles of the face

72
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:20,927
the blend files that I've included in the tutorials package have seen "Simplify" enabled

73
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:29,787
to view models in higher resolution

74
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:33,219
just raise the value for the subdivision level

75
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:38,017
or disable "Simplify"

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
