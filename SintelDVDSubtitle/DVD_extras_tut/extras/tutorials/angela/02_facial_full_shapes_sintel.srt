1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,222
Here in the "Shapes" panel are all the symmetrical shapes for Sintel

2
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:08,314
we have 26 facial and 2 more for pupil dilation

3
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:20,660
while working on facial shapes

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,198
I found that working with "Texture Solid" shading enabled

5
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:26,087
which is in the "Property" shelf under "Display"

6
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:28,263
made it much nicer to work with

7
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:30,841
it gave me feedback on how our textures moved

8
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:33,779
and was close to what she looked like once rendered

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,508
once the jaw and eyelids are rigged and weighted

10
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:45,895
the first thing I do is to open the jaw

11
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:49,114
check and clean up the geometry inside the mouth

12
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,438
after that

13
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:56,366
I start creating a series of isolated shapes in full symmetrical form using "X Mirror" tool

14
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:57,710
I start with proportional editing

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,985
and then move onto editing individual vertex for final polishing

16
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:05,112
I like to work in symmetry

17
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:07,860
because it gives me the full effective in each shape

18
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,983
in the next section

19
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:12,624
you'll see how I break up the shapes to create a symmetry

20
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:30,607
on frame 220 you will notice that the only shape that I include in the rig is the screen shape

21
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:31,901
to create the shape

22
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:36,454
I first placed the eyelid rig and then built my screen shape around it

23
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,443
for each shape

24
00:01:56,453 --> 00:01:59,442
I checked on three things which I call it Three Ms

25
00:01:59,512 --> 00:02:00,947
first: "Motion"

26
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:05,891
I stare between default shape at all angles ensuring everything moves naturally

27
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:07,747
second: "Mixing"

28
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,595
since the goals to create shapes that are mixable

29
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:13,393
I mixed what I'm currently working on with other shapes

30
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:16,141
and that ensures that they blend well together

31
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:18,197
third: "Mouth Open"

32
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:19,321
for all mouth shapes

33
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:25,048
I open the jaw and make sure that each shape is smooth inside the mouth and against the teeth

34
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:29,280
the shapes might not look like much now

35
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,978
and that's because they're meant to be combined together

36
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:38,989
this layering method allows animators more flexibility to build more complex facial expression
