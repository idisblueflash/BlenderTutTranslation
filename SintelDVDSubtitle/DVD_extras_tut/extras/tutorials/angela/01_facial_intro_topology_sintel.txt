Hi I'm Angela Guenette
and I'm going to talk about some of the work I did on the film Sintel
These are the same techniques I've used working in Maya, Softimage XSI
On productions such as the featured film "Everyone's Hero"
and the DVD movie "Barbie as Rapunzel"
and the television "Spider-man: The New Animated Series"
As I demonstrate
these techniques work really well in blender
In this first part
we are going to look at how I organize facial topology specifically for animation use
the vertical span in the center of the face separates the left and right side
for the eye area
the vertical span ran across the pupil
matching the up eyelid center to the bottom eyelid center
as the same center line also divides the inner eyebrow and the outer eyebrow
for the other corners of the mouth
we have three holes onto spans
the center span
which divides upper and lower portion
and two supporting span on either side
the eye area is also organized in same way as the mouth
with center span and two supporting spans on either side
the eyebrow location is clearly defined by two parallel spans
encircling the eye area is a mask like continued span
nose and mouth area are also contained together
this defined the upper and lower portion of the face
using extrude select
you can see how the lip line is defined by two parallel loops
for the luff line
we have a central loop with two supporting loops
and the crease of eyelids are also defined in this way
taking a closer look in 3 quarter of view
you can see how the three parallel spans meet at the top, middle and bottom edge of nostril
the middle span is used to create the crease
also in wireframe they should look like luff lines
additional spans are used to continue the smooth transition inside the mouth and eye-socks
here I'm using Ctrl and Numpad Plus key to increase my selection
building your geometry like this with continued edge loops made it very easy to select areas of the face when working with your model
here you can see closely how the top lip and bottom lip mirror each other
also
vertical spans from top to bottom lineup
taking a closer look at the eyelids
you can see how the topology is organized in the same way as the mouth
the outer edge of the eyelids are also defined by two spans
which are highlighted here in grey color
the next span in fits the eyeball creating a shelf
or the thickness of the eyelid
adding a two-line geometry is a very effective way to add life to the eyes
to make this
I simply duplicate the eyelid shelf and then reshaped it
creating a slide curve that will catch the light better
the cornea is the glossy transparent part increasing the eye
when shaping the eyelids I leave the cornea in solid display
which ensures the proper fit without gaps or intersection
OK
let's hide the proxy here to display the scalp
in the property panel under materials
you can see how I've divided aparts of the topology with individual material colors
the grey topology material clearly displays placement for the hair and eyebrows
it also helps to define where the scalp will end and the forehead begin
now let's select the "topology_lashline" material
this defines where the eyelashes will be
after having these three areas clearly marked
I simply duplicate the mesh to create these particle emitter meshes
to conclude the section on facial topology
let's bring in the shaman and dragon baby beside Sintel to compare
as you can see here
although they each have their own tailor-made topology
from old man to young girl to creature
the inner structure closely follows the same principles 
which pretty much ends up in pre-assembling the muscles of the face
the blend files that I've included in the tutorials package have seen "Simplify" enabled
to view models in higher resolution
just raise the value for the subdivision level
or disable "Simplify"
