1
00:00:00,019 --> 00:00:02,511
Now that Sintel's full shapes are completed

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:06,616
the next step is to create a symmetrical one using "Vertex Groups Weight Painting"

3
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:10,313
in the "Property" panel under "Vertex Group"

4
00:00:10,383 --> 00:00:11,449
I created a new group

5
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,552
and named it "Face_L"

6
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:31,329
in Edit mode I select the central edge loop using Shift Alt Right Mouse Button

7
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:36,382
I then hide the selection with the H key

8
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:39,979
Moving the mouth into Sintel's right side

9
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:42,450
I press L to select the linked

10
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:46,297
back to the "Vertex Group" panel

11
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:48,509
I assign those vertex a weight of 0

12
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:50,642
then deselect all using A

13
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:54,239
the same is done to Sintel's left side

14
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,338
but this time the weight value is changed to 1

15
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:03,955
with the left and right side now done

16
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:06,615
I un-hide the central edge loop using Alt H

17
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:10,053
and assign the center a weight of 0.5

18
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:26,535
weight value of selected vertex can be seen in the Property shelf under Vertex Groups

19
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:44,841
next step is to create a smoother transition

20
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:45,708
to do this

21
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:49,325
I edge-loop select the next span over in the left side

22
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:52,634
and assign it a weight of 0.8

23
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,095
the same is done to the right side 

24
00:01:58,065 --> 00:02:00,606
but this time I assign it 0.2

25
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:02,419
whatever the value on one side

26
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,548
the mirrored side must equal a total of 100%

27
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:06,375
this way

28
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:07,521
when combined together

29
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:10,302
it fix back exactly to the full shape

30
00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:22,309
you can also use Ctrl V key to blend vertex groups

31
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:23,734
but for this purpose

32
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:28,787
I prefer the position I can get by assigning directly selected vertex

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,334
let's switch the mode to Weight Paint

34
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:36,430
and select the face's left vertex group to display the assignment

35
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:40,695
from here I usually go back and tweak the weights a little bit more

36
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:44,930
back to Edit mode

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,730
I copy and paste the face's left vertex group name into the Shapes Key panel under each shape

38
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:02,399
example for "MOUTH-up", "MOUTH-dn", "MOUTH-L" and "MOUTH-twist"

39
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:43,464
here I'm using the Up Arrow to scroll through the list

40
00:03:46,524 --> 00:03:48,736
let's activate the Paint button here

41
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:50,749
to quickly go over the shapes

42
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:56,289
having Paint button activated will always show that current shape at the full one value

43
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,890
overwriting any other shape with values

44
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,526
in Object mode I select the "smile.L" to add its full value of 1

45
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:14,864
select the + button to add new shape

46
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:18,641
the X button clears all shapes to 0

47
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,537
I rename this new shape "MOUTH-Smile.L"

48
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:28,048
next I create a duplicate of that shape

49
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:33,070
clear all shape and by copying and pasting the "MOUTH-Smile.L"

50
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,787
I replace the "L" with "R" for right

51
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,406
having this right shape selected

52
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:53,150
I then click on Mirror Shape Key which flips the shape to the right

53
00:04:56,587 --> 00:05:01,670
dialing both values of left and right to 1 recreates the full smile shape

54
00:05:05,646 --> 00:05:09,303
for the "MOUTH-L" shape and the "MOUTH-twist.L" shape

55
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:13,269
the right side is created by simply using Mirror Shape Key

56
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:18,122
"MOUTH-up" shape and "MOUTH-down" shape are left as is

57
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:46,841
you can always create a new shape key by blending existing ones

58
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:51,694
here I'm combining the "MOUTH-L" with the "MOUTH-twist.L" 

59
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:14,454
Here I'm expanding the window using Shift and Middle Mouse Scroll

60
00:06:14,484 --> 00:06:20,473
all 28 symmetrical shapes have been divided up to create a total of 55 split shapes

61
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,805
including the pupil dilation

62
00:06:22,954 --> 00:06:27,847
at this stage I create the coinsiding shapes for the inner mouth geometry

63
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:31,374
as well as the eyebrow emitter and lashes

64
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:35,311
once all shapes are completed and named properly

65
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:39,605
the next step is to hook these shapes up to the facial rig

66
00:07:18,828 --> 00:07:21,478
using the same vertex weighting method

67
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,597
brows up and down get split in four shapes

68
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,408
left inner and outer

69
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,586
and right inner and outer

70
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,864
here is a Wire view of the mouth shapes working with the facial shapes

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
