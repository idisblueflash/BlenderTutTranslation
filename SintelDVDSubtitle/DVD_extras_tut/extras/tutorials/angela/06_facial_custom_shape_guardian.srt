00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,303
The guardian required the shock specific facial expression which combines several shapes in one

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,230
here we have squinting of the eyes

3
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:18,284
the much corners are pulled down and out

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,387
the upper lip is pulled up and the lower lip is pulled down

5
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:23,550
and we also have the nasal sneer

6
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:29,099
for the brows here makes of mad, sad and raise up

7
00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:35,418
to create the final overall effect of the blend shape

8
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:38,448
I also added the head, eyelids and jaw rig

9
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:42,142
here in the Property shelf

10
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:46,031
you can see the blend shape named "Death Face" at the full 100% value

11
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:48,040
because it's meant to be pushed to the extreme

12
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:51,839
the second version of the death face adds to the movement

13
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:59,398
in the Shape panel you can see the blend shapes which are now controlled by the rig

14
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,351
I also added coinciding shape for the inner mouth geometry
