Now that Sintel's full shapes are completed
the next step is to create a symmetrical one using "Vertex Groups Weight Painting"
in the "Property" panel under "Vertex Group"
I created a new group
and named it "Face_L"
in Edit mode I select the central edge loop using Shift Alt Right Mouse Button
I then hide the selection with the H key
Moving the mouth into Sintel's right side
I press L to select the linked
back to the "Vertex Group" panel
I assign those vertex a weight of 0
then deselect all using A
the same is done to Sintel's left side
but this time the weight value is changed to 1
with the left and right side now done
I un-hide the central edge loop using Alt H
and assign the center a weight of 0.5
weight value of selected vertex can be seen in the Property shelf under Vertex Groups
next step is to create a smoother transition
to do this
I edge-loop select the next span over in the left side
and assign it a weight of 0.8
the same is done to the right side 
but this time I assign it 0.2
whatever the value on one side
the mirrored side must equal a total of 100%
this way
when combined together
it fix back exactly to the full shape
you can also use Ctrl V key to blend vertex groups
but for this purpose
I prefer the position I can get by assigning directly selected vertex
let's switch the mode to Weight Paint
and select the face's left vertex group to display the assignment
from here I usually go back and tweak the weights a little bit more
back to Edit mode
I copy and paste the face's left vertex group name into the Shapes Key panel under each shape
example for "MOUTH-up", "MOUTH-down", "MOUTH-L" and "MOUTH-twist"
here I'm using the Up Arrow to scroll through the list
let's activate the Paint button here
to quickly go over the shapes
having Paint button activated will always show that current shape at the full one value
overwriting any other shape with values
in Object mode I select the "smile.L" to add its full value of 1
select the + button to add new shape
the X button clears all shapes to 0
I rename this new shape "MOUTH-Smile.L"
next I create a duplicate of that shape
clear all shape and by copying and pasting the "MOUTH-Smile.L"
I replace the "L" with "R" for right
having this right shape selected
I then click on Mirror Shape Key which flips the shape to the right
dialing both values of left and right to 1 recreates the full smile shape
for the "MOUTH-L" shape and the "MOUTH-twist.L" shape
the right side is created by simply using Mirror Shape Key
"MOUTH-up" shape and "MOUTH-down" shape are left as is
you can always create a new shape key by blending existing ones
here I'm combining the "MOUTH-L" with the "MOUTH-twist.L" 
Here I'm expanding the window using Shift and Middle Mouse Scroll
all 28 symmetrical shapes have been divided up to create a total of 25 split shapes
including the pupil dilation
at this stage I create the coinsiding shapes for the inner mouth geometry
as well as the eyebrow emitter and lashes
once all shapes are completed and named properly
the next step is to hook these shapes up to the facial rig
using the same vertex weighting method
brows up and down get split in four shapes
left inner and outer
and right inner and outer
here is a Wire view of the mouth shapes working with the facial shapes
