00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,007
Here we have all blended shapes connected to the facial rig

2
00:00:05,036 --> 00:00:07,000
now ready for animation

3
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:12,797
at this stage I tested everything else but creating a series of quick and basic facial poses

4
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:16,957
which include a series of both bone names and emotions

5
00:00:18,787 --> 00:00:22,071
each bones is keyed on every 10 frames

6
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:30,265
doing this text provides me with feedback on how well everything posed together overall

7
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:33,751
and ensures a good range that still looks pretty natural

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:40,193
since the shapes all now being controlled by the facial rig

9
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:43,506
animators use the controls to key poses

10
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:04,932
to speed up my workflow

11
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,665
I enable the AutoKey

12
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:15,370
OK let's add two more poses

13
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:16,786
one on frame 260

14
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:19,145
and the other one on frame 270

15
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:22,939
in the DopeSheet

16
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:25,192
default values have already been keyed

17
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:27,783
which allows me a blank canvas to start with

18
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:34,418
to create poses

19
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:37,489
I include jaw, eyelids and tone controls

20
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:41,428
but not till the end of the head, eye direction or pupil dilations

21
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,219
so let's hide these controls

22
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:17,458
now let's move on to frame 270 to create the pose

23
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:21,645
on frame 270 you can see how her face resets to default 

24
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:28,506
saving default values every 10 frames ahead of time created a very quick and easy workflow

25
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:46,622
here I'm checking on the transition

26
00:06:46,585 --> 00:06:48,753
it's moving smoothly and naturally

27
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:38,813
when working this closely to Sintel's face in perspective

28
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,616
I leave the camera lens to 90

29
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:51,729
switching the lens back to its default 35 creates an inaccurate distortion of the face

30
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,982
so I just leave it at 90

31
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,246
starting with basic symmetrical shapes seen in the full shapes tutorial portion

32
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:37,975
you can see how we can now achieve a nice range of a symmetrical movement in the face

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
