For each Sintel
start with the young Sintel
and all her shape keys
I then simply added one aging shape key and named it "sintel_scene8"
this aging shape key was also added to her shirt, inside mouth, eyebrow emit, top and bottom eyelash emit as well as her tear line
when left on
the shape fits into all the rest of the shapes which alters the model
I then went back to check out all existing facial shapes held up
they all worked well so we left as is
since the aging shape is on the slider
the range can be adjusted to any desired value for the movie
overwriting the full value of the shape even further or age her even more
