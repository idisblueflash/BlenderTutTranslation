00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,008
Hello, my name is David REVOY

2
00:00:02,034 --> 00:00:06,255
welcome to this video tutorial series indicated to 2D digital painting

3
00:00:06,204 --> 00:00:08,315
with free and open sources softwares

4
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:15,002
this video would mainly show you how I manage my graffiti process through a simple illustration

5
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:18,740
I will use three softwares

6
00:00:18,994 --> 00:00:20,825
the first is Alchemy

7
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:23,368
for the external story creative start

8
00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:24,970
the second is Mypaint

9
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:26,699
as the main painting program

10
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:29,089
and finally the third is Gimp

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:35,141
with the patch "Gimp-for -Painter" and toolset "Gimp Paint Studio" for mainly image manipulation

12
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:39,489
All of these are on my favourite operating system - Linux Mint

13
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:42,210
So let's get in

14
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:49,712
To Protect sensitives ears against the French accent, all the following video will be musical.

1. Chaos with Alchemy

17
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:09,727
Alchemy look at first as a basic 2D tools, but it have originals features.
In this tutorial, I show how to use it as a CHAOS generator.

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,524
As you can see, the user interface is pretty minimalistic.
Just go over the top apps to let appear the main toolbar

19
00:01:32,355 --> 00:01:39,386
We can add effects or modifier on the brush stroke to have more random shapes.
I use mainly "Speed shapes" and "Pull shapes" here.

20
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:05,605
Pretty chaos :)
But for what???

21
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:13,834
We want here to be creative, and to have a totally new result.
Starting from a Chaos is a great solution.

22
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:20,692
Chaos will bring us incredible new organics and geometrics shapes
and we will just underline what we see from it

23
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:31,092
As children play to guess "What this could look like?" during watching the sky.
A strong creative process.

24
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:44,464
I underline here in red a girl faces to better show you what I see in this chaos at first

25
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:58,817
And I try to render the 2D way what I see using the "solid shape" brush with just opacity

26
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:15,104
I didn't like a lot this idea. So I just continue my Chaos work over.
In Alchemy, no "undo"

27
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:31,473
New shapes appear very fast, and also depend of personal interpretation

28
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:45,848
I would be curious to know what do you see in all those splatters of shape.
It's kind revelant most of the time....

29
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:20,499
Now you understand the process, let's speed the video to the end of this first part.

30
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,656
That's all for the Alchemy part, of course Alchemy can do a lot of other things, this will be in future's videos. :)

31
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,318
To finish, just save your result as flat PNG file format. I will use only this file format in this tutorial...

2. Black and white painting

34
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:13,429
I opened Gimp to prepare my drawing a bit:
I need to make it darker (multiply layer) and resize this base to a higher resolution.

35
00:05:38,856 --> 00:05:46,584
After, I switch to Mypaint and start a paint over with my basic brush set (you can find it on the Mypaint forum).
I start with the head: the main focal point.

36
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:11,013
At this step I use the mirror a lot;
It help my eyes to have a refreshing view of the face, and see all my proportions errors.

37
00:06:27,632 --> 00:06:37,853
After finishing to paint the face, I switch to Gimp to correct the proportions with a simple cut/transform/paste process.

38
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:51,314
I crop too the artwork to a better size using the good option of the crop tools "rules of the third" that display an helpful gird.

39
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:09,594
I paint a bit with Gimp to reconstruct voids parts,
but all the brush are very slow at this resolution.
I start also to light some part, using layer blending modes.

40
00:07:30,202 --> 00:07:37,680
back to Mypaint. I paint on the whole surface of the painting, keeping a view mode that display all my illustration on the screen.
I continue the B&W painting.

41
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:24,046
I keep it speed painting to go to the next step: Color!

42

43
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:33,768
To color my black & white speed painting
I use mostly layers with blending mode (color/multiply/dodge)

44
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:47,645
I also flatten image very often,
and use the tools as "levels","color curves", "colorise", "hue/saturation" to adjust better colors.

45
00:08:53,628 --> 00:09:00,358
Color step is always the best moment to try a lot of possibility:
Here I focus on cold blue/green palette, with my focus points more warms.

46
00:09:37,584 --> 00:09:42,487
When I'm happy with the general palette, I switch to Mypaint.

47
00:09:55,117 --> 00:10:00,518
All Mypaint's tools can have custom keyboard shortcuts.

48
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:31,928
4. Details

49
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:07,409
Details step is very long...
It represents around 60% of all the drawing time

50
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:28,265
This timelapse video is accelerate;
time is between 25 and 30 times more than normal

51
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:59,093
At normal time speed, all this illustration took 7hour and 30min.
I did it in 3 steps, and on 2 different days.

52
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:12,548
All details are created with the same creative process in part.1...
I always try to recognise in random shaping something.

53
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:19,189
All ideas born during the painting,
I didn't block myself to an idea at first.
That's the most pleasant way to paint.  :-)

54
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:34,223
Still switching Between Mypaint and Gimp all the time...
Blending layers as "Multiply" or "Dodge" are very useful to fix shadows.

55
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:55,246
5. Finishing

56
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:14,856
Back to Mypaint, I use the brush system to create some textures
and continuing adding details

57
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:42,264
At the end, I switch a last time in Gimp to do the final crop, and paste my signature.

58
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:12,510
The End
Thanks for watching
