00:00:05,275 --> 00:00:11,182
General forms are sculpted first at a low resolution

3
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:25,039
It's important to sculpt the general shapes at a low resolution to prevent unwanted lumpiness

4
00:00:25,014 --> 00:00:29,317
The clay, draw, smooth, and grab brushes are good for this stage

5
00:00:48,498 --> 00:00:56,860
Try to perfect the current resolution before sculpting at a higher resolution.

6
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:22,893
Save the small details for last

7
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:35,607
A textured brush isn't used because it lacks control over continuity and growth patterns of scales.

8
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:53,110
Flows of scales that contour underlying shapes are sculpted first.

9
00:02:56,052 --> 00:03:01,011
Areas between these flows are patched with smaller scales that don't follow a pattern

10
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:44,182
A textured brush with are enabled allows multiple cuts to be made at once

11
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:23,442
The last step is to use a textured brush to give everything a bit of variety.
