Hi, my name is Colin Levy

and I'm the director of project Durian, aka Sintel

and I wanna show you guys a little bit about the structure of our "Ani" folder within our Durian production repository

this is the directory that I, sort of, maintain throughtout the duriation of the project

and specificly, tha "animatic_edit.blend", which is where the most updated version of the movie always was, as we were working on it

so, right here, this is the whole repository

as you can see, the biggest folder or directory is "pro"

that's for production files, textures, models, scenes

"ani" is actually just mainly renders that is, you know, taking up all our space

so go into "ani" directory and you'll see this "animatic_edit.blend" 
 
let's just open that up

oh, sorry it's already open

OK, so here is the animatic_edit, and as you can see it's a sequencer that is open

and the frame range goes from 0 to 21312

21000 frames

so, as I described here, you'll see the entire movie

and this is... we're currently looking at the ColorGrade scene

so this, up here, is where you can access all different scenes in the file

and basically, everything is like a different sequence 

it's basically a different edit of something

a lot of them have to do with the exact same thing that you're looking at here, the whole... you know, the final movie

this is the one that we have set this upon colorgrading

but you'll see a couple of them, look very similar

so if we go to "MASTER Edit"

this one is a lot more complex

expand this

hoo... it smokes!

look at all this... you know, a lot of stuff here

but essentially, it just goes through, and it's the same thing

what is happening here behind the scenes is,

I'm just gonna go to ColorGrade

because it's all simpler to look at

thse are referencing files in the end of the directory

if you're looking that the Strip Input, over here

we can access that by hitting N

we'll see that in the end of the directory there's a "render" folder, in "render", there's a "O4.1c_comp.avi"

so I'm just gonna hide blender for a second

so we can check out the "render" folder

and in this folder, there are some folders, like subfolders

but most of these are AVIs that have been generated from image sequences of exr files that we have rendered from the farm

so just open up a random shot

OK, so this is an example shot that we get back from farm

that happens automatically, or happend automatically, as we were working on it

in the render directory, now you'll see that every shot actually has a corresponding AVI in the "render_gl" folder

and this is the OpenGL, like playblasts of animation

so, probably should be called "animation_gl"

but it's like... OpenGL is ready to be rendered

and these actually are oriental folders, so we've the same shot, you'll see this is what it looks like before it's rendered

but this will finally replace in the edit, when this is all we had

you know, there's a mix....could be a majority project... there's a mix of storyboards, layout, OpenGL renders, and then final renders

I'm, so, going back to blender

you can see right now, and this ColorGrade sequence, all the areas, this is like the simple version of everything, of the edit

so this is the final edit with only the renders linked in

if you go back to "MASTER Edit"

this is the one that I was maintaining throughout

so this is the one that I worked on for the majority project

and basically for some scenes, there are 3 levels

there is, the final render

I'm gonna just press H to hide

underneath that, there's the OpenGL

and underneath that, is my layout

so this is an interesting way to look at the progressional scenes

so if I actually hide the top 2 layers of all these render strips and the the render_gl strips

I'm gonna press H

you can have... you can take a look at what the layout was

so this is what I spent reduced time in the project Durian, is figuring out the blocking in the characters, the blocking in the camera moves, the edit in the timing

so this basical tool that was handy to the animators

but the timing is actually pretty good

I mean, right for this particular scene, the frame is accuate

so whatever the timing in the layout was, that's so much time the animator had to do their work

so I'm just gonna unhide the render_gl scene

so that you can see when you are working on the scene, and you'll see that, you know, shots are not consistent

you know, sometimes it's a proxy models, sometimes it's forward models£¬sometimes characters are missing, like in the shot

but it's really interesting to take a look at 

and then finally the renders

now, not everything is so needly on layout

the process of woking on Durian, I think, was a lot more messy than Big Buck Bunny which had... which was very very structured

if you look at the animatic... the "live_edit.blend" from the Big Buck Bunny repository

it looks beautiful

there are MetaStrips that you can tab into

but you can see the the storyboards, the layout, or the animatic, all the in the final film, is all framed and markered

and nothing is missing basically

and here, it's a little bit more random

timing direrent change between layout and animation and sometimes uncertainly between storyboard and layout

so, one of the things that I do need in the project was I made a 4-split view of the film, where you can see the final film

and you can see the animatic, the layout and storyboards edited to that final timing

so if you check out the, for example, the layout

go into the Scenes -> "4split-layout"

and this is the layout for the entire scene, for the entire film with the timing of that final movie

so there's a little bit of shifting around to make it match

same thing with "open_gl"

this can, of course, be a lot more exact

and the "storyboards"

you're gonna have to Tab into this MetaStrip

so that the proportions are right, interesting

none of these storyboards seem to be linking in

that's because they are all relative absolute paths

OK, this is gonna have to be fixed

sorry, blocked, to fix this

this is just gonna change the path, like so

so we've got storyboards, but this is edited retrospectively

and my point is, that this is, maybe interesting, to look at

but probably more interesting is to actually look at storyboards as they were when I edit them originally

so we actually have a scene for that

if you go into the Scene menu again, "Storyboards"

this is actually, you know, a copy of the scene of the whole film as it was when project was only existed in storyboards

which, you know, we have limited amount of time to do

so they are not beautiful

and unforturately, probably most audio would not linked in

but this is... there wasn't much audios, just for the two small scenes

so, that might be interesting 

there are a lot of the transformed final strips, just because of the work being done in 2.5, especially the sequencers' stuff probably do not have animation any more

it's really annoying

but I did do a little bit of camera movement in the storyboards

but it's such a pain to retain that data

because as soon as you move stuff around, because it's pretty buggy at the time, I will lose it

so, in this case, on this strip, this probably animation data

if I go over to this view, which is the Graph Editor

you'll see these two channels, "Scale X", "Scale Y", so that's what I animated

press Home, you'll see that in fact there are curves here

and really that should be lined up with the end with the playhead right here

I'm gonna  maximize this, and just move those strips...er, those curves over

do same thing here

and move that beginning

it's now this... well, timing needs work

but that's closer to what we actually had

it's gonna be as quick as dulling probably

and we've also got the teaser trailer

edit it here£¬ which might also interesting to look at

so, what else, "2k"

these reference, I mean, unless you are active bunners too, these are not gonna work for you

because these reference are shared directory, and there's all "2K" JPGs we can swap them out for EXRs using script over here, on the top right

but this was the sequence that we... the actual sequence we used to export the final movie

Oh, one quick thing, you might be wondering what this layer is, of these, like yellow strips

and that is actually what we end up using for a scene markers  

the current implementation of the markers, the feature, is a little bit hacky

that's my personal knowledge

basically, one of the things I wanted early was to have those markers automatically transform with, whatever, the strips shared in movie

so, like... for example, if I have everything to the right of the playhead selected, which is Ctrl Right click

and then I move, right now, they do move with you transformation if you have "Transform Markers" taken down

however, if I deselect those, you know, the strips... I don't know, grab this guy and move it

grab this guy and move it

we'll see actually the markers are moving, too

so the markers do not... the selection of the markers have to be done here, instead of the actual sequencer

so, anyway, it's just a bit sort of a pain and, of course, unforunately£¬and unhopfully change

but it's just a lot easier for us, for youngs, especially to know where the timging is changed for sort of any purposes

and musics too

I just have these in visible color strips

hovering above the change between each of our scenes

and they can be named and furnctions basically the same 

OK, so that is that

I think this... no, unless you have a 4G render files in Durian directory

this is probably of limited use to you

but in terms of how we set it up, how we actually worked with blender to maintain whole edit

I mean it's pretty straight forward

and I'm not really sure what else to share

if you have questions certainly let me know 

and maybe I can do another video

thanks
