Hi, my name is Colin Levy, and my the director of project durian, aka(also known as) Sintel

2
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:14,921
I want to show you guys little bit by the structure of our ANI folder within our durian production repository

3
00:00:14,992 --> 00:00:21,624
this is a .. the dirctory that isolate contain the dirctories of the project, and specifically

4
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:31,070
the animatic_edit.blend which is where the most updated version of the movie always was as you organize

5
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:43,033
so this is , right here, this is  the whole repository as you can see and  the biggest folder directory is 

6
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:47,434
PRO nahz proproduction files, textures, models, scences

7
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:53,280
 any exactly just mean the renders that's you know take up lots  space

8
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:59,763
so go into the any directory and you'll see this animatic_edit.blend which should open that up

9
00:00:59,863 --> 00:01:05,914
sorry to open, ok , so here is the animatic_edit

10
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:10,404
and as you can see, it's a sequencer does it open

11
00:01:10,423 --> 00:01:21,229
and the frame range goes from  0 to 21312, 21 thousands frames

12
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:26,040
so, as I described here, it's the entire movie

13
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,595
and, this is we currently looking at the color gray scence

14
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:41,998
so these up here, is where we can access all  the pre-scences in the file, basically every scence is like different sequence

15
00:01:42,098 --> 00:01:44,036
it's basically an different editor or something

16
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:50,390
a lot of them has to do the exactly same things you looking at here, you know the final movie

17
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,577
this is the one, that we had set up the ColorGrading

18
00:01:54,677 --> 00:02:01,748
but you'll see a couple of them, looks very similar, so if you goto the MASTER Edit

19
00:02:01,848 --> 00:02:05,108
this has a lot more complex

20
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:14,969
as mine this, holy smokes, look at all these, you know , a lot of stuffs here
