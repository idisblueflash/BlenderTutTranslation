1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,756
So this is actually one of my favourite little features

2
00:00:03,856 --> 00:00:06,932
there is a way in Maya to do this

3
00:00:06,947 --> 00:00:08,325
but now in blender

4
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:09,761
and so I asked Campbell

5
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:13,735
and he spent like 30 seconds running this feature

6
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:15,635
it is extremely exciting

7
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:18,985
so I'm going to duplicate this cube

8
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,654
and set up the parent, child

9
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:24,149
a little hot key here

10
00:00:24,249 --> 00:00:30,270
basically all what I wanna be about to do is move along this chain

11
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:33,120
and so by using the bracket keys

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,941
you can now navigate through them

13
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:37,717
so cool

14
00:00:37,817 --> 00:00:42,823
and you can even hit Shift and select, you know, multiple

15
00:00:42,903 --> 00:00:46,108
and it's pretty smart the way it works

16
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,125
now I've got sort of a branch 

17
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,150
this one is the parent of all of them

18
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:54,238
settled there

19
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:56,493
this is also the child of this parent

20
00:00:56,566 --> 00:01:00,714
by hitting bracket right

21
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:02,171
it selects both

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,072
I'm not really sure how it will deal with the active one

23
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:06,566
probably the longer chain

24
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,639
in this case

25
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:11,657
it is incredibly useful and use it all time

26
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:12,912
you should 

27
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:14,304
let's see

28
00:01:14,297 --> 00:01:16,494
the other thing that I want show you is...

29
00:01:16,538 --> 00:01:21,266
I'm gonna open up a particular dance shot from Durian

30
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:24,493
and so it's another Campbell feature

31
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:31,600
so, as you can see this is a pretty intense shot

32
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:33,899
if I enable all layers and holy smokes

33
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:35,110
what's is going on

34
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:38,178
I can barely see the scene

35
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,137
but if you look, hit the N key to open up this tab on the right

36
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:44,125
A to close this up

37
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:46,561
and under the Display tab

38
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,548
there's a Only Render option

39
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:52,095
what that will do is locate everything that doesn't render

40
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:58,295
rigs, cameras, empties, curves...  And make them disappeared under the view port

41
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:00,703
and wow look the clean that is

42
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:02,893
you can actually see what is going on

43
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:04,082
very handy

44
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:08,020
if you open up any files from the Durian repository

45
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,906
and you can't select things

46
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,197
that's why

47
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,627
so untoggle Only Render 

48
00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:16,331
anyway

49
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,071
awesome feature?

50
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:21,509
Part of 4 is next

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
