00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,713
OK, so the next thing I wanna show you I'm just wanna pick up where I locked off

2
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:10,939
Is a pretty handy way of working with lights

3
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:13,275
So I'm just gonna add a spot light here

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:17,449
And since it's selected I'm going to go into it with Ctrl 0

5
00:00:17,532 --> 00:00:18,980
And here we are

6
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:24,516
It looks as if we are in the camera view so you can do everything that you can normally do from a camera view

7
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:25,666
Namely, Fly

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,698
So Shift F is entering the fly mode

9
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:34,323
And from there you can point and, you know, aim your light

10
00:00:34,386 --> 00:00:37,158
you can use R to rotate

11
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:42,695
or double R to sort of grab on something and look around

12
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:45,694
and if I just put the view here

13
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:49,721
and fold these stupid things

14
00:00:50,019 --> 00:01:04,372
you can also see that the clipping plane that you've normally associated with the camera is the same thing as through the clip start and clip end

15
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:07,837
so if I...(I just bring it really low)...

16
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:17,807
You can actually see from within the camera view how much they like is able to shadow

17
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:21,054
and just that could be really useful when you need it to be precise

18
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:24,447
so ya, that's that

19
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:28,285
and one of the things that makes it a little bit annoying is

20
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:34,224
currently it's not really an easy way to get back to the camera view where you were

21
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:40,873
I think the previous version 2.49 you could do the same thing getting Ctrl 0

22
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:43,041
or something and get back to where you were

23
00:01:43,117 --> 00:01:46,686
it's more like a toggle, maybe, I forgot what it's probably said

24
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:49,366
but if you're using camera markers

25
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:54,853
it's easy enough to Ctrl click and jump right back where you were

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,246
so that's another reason to use camera binding 

27
00:01:58,275 --> 00:01:59,236
Um... Let's see...

28
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,012
I think that's it

29
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:01,983
this is getting shorter

30
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:02,566
Bye
