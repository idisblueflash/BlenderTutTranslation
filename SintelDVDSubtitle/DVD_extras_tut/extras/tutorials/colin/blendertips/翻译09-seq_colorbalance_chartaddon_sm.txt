OK, so I'd like to show you a couple of sequencer features for your quick

那么，下面我来给大家讲一下序列功能



the first I just wanna do general file selection thing

我首先来选择文件

I'm gonna add an image sequence

并添加一个图像序列(Shift+A)



just can navigate to this tab

不管是添加那种序列



whatever the sequence



都先切换到这个窗口



what you can do is, actually, let's say these PNGs are mixed in with tons of various kinds of files



其实吧，所谓的PNG就是一堆连续的图像文件


you can add... Do a *.png

你只要在上面输入 *.png


and you will automatically select all of the files of that extension

就可以自动选择所有这样的扩展名(PNG)的文件


that's really handy

相当地方便啊！

a little thing

（方便啊！）



now here right now is actually the correct aspect create issue
现在需要做的是修正一下导入后的图片显示问题

a lot of times you bring something in
很多时候你导入了一些东西


and it's completely distorted
结果发现全都悲剧了。。。

so my first step usually is after I've imported something
所以导入后的第一步！


to go to Strip

菜单 Strip->Set Render Size

Set Render Size

菜单 Strip->Set Render Size

and what that's gonna do is



于是接下来...


if you go to Shift F7

或者你按 Shift+F7


and look at dimensions

然后看尺寸(dimensions)一栏


it's going to set the dimensions of the project to whatever that actually file is

这里可以调整导入文件的尺寸分辨率等等，使其和文件一致


so let's just say that comes in like this

这里我们假设它就是这样


I'm gonna go Strip -> Set Render Size

菜单 Strip->Set Render Size


and as soon as you change the frame

然后当你移动当前帧时


you will see that is just set correctly

你会看到它已经设置好了


so now I'm gonna open up the aminatic edit

现在我来打开aminatic edit


and just show you a really color balance stuff we are doing



然后来告诉你色彩平衡的事


and... gonna change the scene to ColorGrade

将场景(scene)切换到ColorGrade


as so



喵~


these are referencing AVI files

这里是AVI的参考文件


and basically there is a really cool addon

顺便说一下，这里有个非常给力的插件



which allows you to take any property of the given strip

可以让你获得strip的属性

and allow you to apply that same properties or values to other strips

以及将该属性应用到其他的strip上



and this is useful especially when you are doing color correction with the Color Balance tools here

这个功能在你想调整色彩和色彩平衡时尤为有用



they are pretty basic, but really nice to work with

简单实用


and, so, let's just assume that I wanted to give this entire scene a really green fill

那么，假设我要让整个影片场景绿起来


I wanna make it look like that 

绿油油的！

by the way, you can use Shift to make this ultra sensitive

你同样可以按住Shift键进行微调


what I'm going to do is going to the User Preference

接下来切换到 User Preference 窗口


Ctrl Alt U

按 
Ctrl + Alt + U

and go to the Add-Ons pane

进入插件面板

and I've already searched for "chart"

我这里已经在搜索 "chart" 了


but we are looking indeed for the Property Chart

但实际上我们要找的是属性图表


and you can just go ahead and enable it

启用它


and... (oops)

喵？


now at the bottom you would see the Property Chart

现在在下面你能看到属性圆饼图了


and it's already got all these properties enabled

这里已经将所有属性启用了

the basic I would have done is

下面要做的是


if I got this strip selected

如果我选择了这个strip


use Color Balance

应用色彩平衡


I can hover over a property like Lift

我可以把鼠标悬停在某个属性上，比如说"Lift"

and take a look at with the Python line says "SequenceColorBalance.lift"

于是可以看到 Python 一行显示："SequenceColorBalance.lift"


and you can see here that I've got "Use_color_balance.lift"

然后你可以看到这里也有 "Use_color_balance.lift"


"color_balance.gamma"

"color_balance.gamma"



"color_balance.gain"


"color_balance.gain"



so these are properties that I've just basically copy and paste into here

所以这里的属性都是我刚刚复制粘贴过来的


and that becomes what the chart is

他和上面圆饼图的一样


so let's just say I want... Let's go ahead and make this green as we've designed

就按我刚刚说的，我们来让它绿起来！


excellent that's perfect

不错~


now I wanna apply that to the rest of the scene

现在再把它们应用到剩下的场景中去


you see, as soon as I selected, the chart increases to the selection



你看，我一选中，他就出现了这些选项



and color balance is not enabled on this strip

色彩平衡在这个strip上没有启用



the first thing I wanna do is make that enabled

我们先来启用它


now the gamma selection is changed

gamma选项改变了颜色


so this one his a slightly more green hue

它有了一点点的绿色色度

and I'll just copy the gamma



我可以直接复制gamma选项

so, right now, if you like this chart it's pretty normal

现在，如果你觉得这个太正常了


copy it over

粘贴覆盖它


and now the gamma is that green tint for the entire scene

于是所有的都绿了


that's pretty nifty

绿得好给力啊！

now if delete this actually right now I'm sure I'm having a bug with Property Chart

现在如果删掉这个，我确定会属性图表会出BUG


where it completely disappeared

你看，它们都不见了


but I could just say "color_saturation" I can just add that to the property chart

但是我只是说我刚刚加了"color_saturation"(色彩饱和度)给属性图


I'm undoing, so it doesn't disappeared



撤销上一步，于是它们又出现咯

and say, I gonna type "color_saturation"



然后，输入"color_saturation"

and I can see that saturation has replaced the color that we had before

于是，饱和度替换了刚刚显示的颜色

so I can just make it completely this saturated

我可以把它们都设定成这样的饱和度


border selected these guys, and apply

范围选中这个家伙，然后应用


now, saturation is down to 0 for the entire thing

现在，所有的饱和度都变成0了

so it's a pretty handy tool which I thought you should know about



方便吧，大家要记住这个工具哦~


so yep, that's it for this subside of blender tips with Colin Levy



喵~这就是 Colin Levy 的不楞德尔小知识~
