1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:02,811
So, I'm currently at home

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:07,010
I probably assume I'm gonna run out of the features to demonstrate

3
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:10,099
So it's just probably do a couple of more

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:14,750
But right I'm gonna show you a "projection editing"

5
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:17,888
Forget what the term it actually was

6
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:20,942
When I was under 2.49, there is a different way of doing this

7
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:21,310
this is really cool

8
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:26,815
this is basically the feature that allows you to take a base of geometry that has deformations 

9
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:28,397
you know, it's not a plane

10
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:38,164
and you can take another object when you're editing the mesh that have the vertices automatically snap to the surfaces underneath

11
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:40,448
and it's really a great modeling tool

12
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:44,710
anyway, its approach in 2.5 is a little bit different

13
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:48,389
so I can either... Well, I just use this cube, since it's here

14
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:54,199
with Ctrl 2 just add a Subsurf modifier and make it smooth

15
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,907
so here we go

16
00:00:55,927 --> 00:00:58,315
and I'm just gonna add a plane

17
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:02,480
and, basically...er... Rotate with double R

18
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:05,653
just because I want it to be outside

19
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:06,798
OK

20
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:11,345
so, basically we have to be in Shaded mode, I believe

21
00:01:11,476 --> 00:01:16,412
and this tool actually is a snapping feature which makes sense

22
00:01:16,502 --> 00:01:22,048
this feature was not immigrated in the snapping tools, I believe in 2.49

23
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:24,853
but here at the bottom of the 3D view 

24
00:01:24,964 --> 00:01:27,248
we can toggle on Snapping

25
00:01:27,636 --> 00:01:30,406
and here right next to it is your snapping options

26
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:31,864
so let's click that

27
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:32,836
and go to Face

28
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,501
because it's gonna snap those vertices to the faces underneath

29
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:42,047
and, then, this is important to a magical button

30
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:43,588
right here

31
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:46,850
"Project vertices on the surface of other objects"

32
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,822
so just can toggle that on

33
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:50,224
we just wanna do

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,355
there, interesting

35
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,750
now I'm gonna prove that 

36
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:55,986
alright, so I'm going to Edit Mode

37
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:57,311
hit G

38
00:01:57,554 --> 00:02:00,532
and suddenly, as all we have to do, to need moving it

39
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:06,405
those four points have snapped to the surface of the object underneath

40
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:09,827
I need to just toggle Subsurf on more

41
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:14,880
so we can see, and, we're gonna subdivide to several times on this plane

42
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:16,796
we can always see it by then

43
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:19,753
now under Shade mode we can 

44
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:22,009
and we're gonna press G again

45
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:28,902
and it's actually going to just confirm perfectly to the form of that sphere

46
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:30,381
beautiful

47
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,894
and you might be going like this 

48
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:35,761
right now, it looks like it's still not doing it right 

49
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,558
but if I change the view

50
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:40,925
you will see how it's actually deformed those points

51
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:43,063
so it's really a handy modeling tool

52
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:47,499
if you've got the shape of a model 

53
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,567
that looks great, but the edge loops are not working

54
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:55,308
it is really a great way to start to work

55
00:02:55,408 --> 00:03:01,118
anyway, that is that pretty cool feature, pretty easy, as well.
