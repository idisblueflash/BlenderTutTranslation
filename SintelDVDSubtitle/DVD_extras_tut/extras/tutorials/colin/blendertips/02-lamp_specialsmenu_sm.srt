00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,264
Hello 

2
00:00:01,245 --> 00:00:04,430
and welcome to the Blendr's Tips of Colin Levy Part 2

3
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:08,538
first I wanna show you is the special menu of light

4
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:10,630
so duplicating a couple of lights here

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,370
turning this one to spot

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,405
and gonna make a buffer shadow 

7
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:16,221
now to focus this light

8
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:20,405
I normally go into here and change spot shape

9
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:22,915
and, you know, change Autoclip and...

10
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:26,652
but you can actually access these settings very quickly with the W key

11
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:28,164
to enter this Specials menu

12
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:32,737
so that you can change the spot size, the blend, so you can see

13
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:34,725
I'll rotate like this

14
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:39,993
clip start and end for shadows and and that's nice and handy, very fast

15
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:42,588
and it works specially for buffer shadow lamps

16
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:45,118
but you can also change the settings for all of them

17
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:49,653
so you notice that if you hit W key

18
00:00:49,753 --> 00:00:54,655
this last feature called "Isolate Render Selection"

19
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,165
so I'm just gonna apologize right there

20
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,892
actually we've just forward in time two weeks

21
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:02,766
I am at home right now

22
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:06,341
basically I have to re-record the seonc part of this tutorial

23
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,754
because actually blender's functionality has changed

24
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:12,112
so I've got three lights here 

25
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:15,203
and now if you hit the Specials menu

26
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:18,531
you will see that this feature has been updated

27
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:20,832
and no loger you'll have...

28
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:23,180
oh, I forgot what the term actually was 

29
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,482
but now we have two updates here 

30
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:29,627
Restrict Render Unselected and Clear All Restrict Render

31
00:01:29,727 --> 00:01:31,824
er... confusing

32
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:33,735
so to see what's this does

33
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:38,413
let's open up the Outliner and set it to Same Types

34
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:45,373
what's this gonna do is everything in your scene that's of same types

35
00:01:45,383 --> 00:01:48,150
whatever you have selected will show up here

36
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,728
in this case I got one lamp selected

37
00:01:49,738 --> 00:01:53,370
so all the lamps gonna in the scene that are not selected gonna show up

38
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:58,581
when I change selection to this cube you'll see all the meshs of the objects

39
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:01,386
so here we go

40
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:03,269
we see three lamps here and

41
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:13,471
basically these features here make it very easy to isolate one of them or several to render

42
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,932
a lot of time you will be working on complex scenes

43
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:18,948
with ton of light all over the place 

44
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:25,452
it's really important to be able to very quickly know what each of the individual light is doing 

45
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:30,549
and fix, for example, shadow buffer issue with one of your lamps and if you don't want know which one it is

46
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:33,087
this is a quick way, sort of a test

47
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:35,541
so I've got one light selected

48
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,163
and I wanna see this light in the render all by itself

49
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:40,400
so by hitting W

50
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:41,341
the Specials menu

51
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,946
and going to the Restrict Render Unselected

52
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:48,120
that's going to look all of the objects in the same type 

53
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,889
whatever isn't selected

54
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:52,057
it's gonna hide them from renderbility

55
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:54,282
so, as you see

56
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:59,379
now this is the only one that has the render icon toggled on

57
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,535
I mean other two lamps are off

58
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:04,409
and to restore it

59
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:09,515
you can go now to the W menu - Clear All Restrict Render

60
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:12,767
so everything is of the same type would now be renderable 

61
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:15,885
and you can do this with multiple things of course

62
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,873
and that whould make this one to toggle off

63
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:27,239
now another related handy shortcut to hide objects that are selected remain renderable is Ctrl H

64
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:31,204
so let's say you have twenty-five lamps all over the place

65
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:34,484
and you want one of them to not render

66
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:36,776
so is the inverse situation

67
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:41,007
you can just selected and with your mouse just over the 3D view

68
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:42,424
Ctrl H

69
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,853
and you'll see the Outliner that the renderability icon is now off

70
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:52,703
and you can use Ctrl Alt H to bring it back

71
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,140
but you can, in this case, you can also just say Clear All Restrict Render

72
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,298
and it just will bring all back

73
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:03,761
and this is also useful for other thing than lights

74
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:06,889
but that would be the feature that was implemented for

75
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:09,390
and... it's really really handy

76
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,474
I used it a lot

77
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:12,956
and while we are here, one last thing

78
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:14,829
I wanna show this really cool feature

79
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,951
which you've probably known about

80
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:18,404
which is in the Sport Shape menu

81
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:22,341
a little toggle dragged down called Show Cone

82
00:04:22,407 --> 00:04:28,531
so if you toggle that on you can now see in the 3D view where your lights are hidding

83
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:30,937
and that's really useful to know

84
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,009
a lot of time it's just hard to visualize

85
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:35,529
it's just really nice a little tool

86
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,677
OK. see you in Part 3
