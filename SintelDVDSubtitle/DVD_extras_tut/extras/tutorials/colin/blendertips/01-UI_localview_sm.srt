Hello, this is Colin Levy

2
00:00:02,142 --> 00:00:02,879
How are you

3
00:00:02,987 --> 00:00:09,520
I thought I'll be interesting to do a series of really short and less than one-minute videos

4
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:16,351
to show you tips and tricks that I learned in blender during my time on Sintel

5
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:19,572
er I thought I knew blender

6
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:23,327
but apparently there's a lot of people who know a lot of things that I didn't know

7
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:29,460
everything in this little series gonna be simple, really simple

8
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:31,064
so to jump right in

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,670
first I wanna show you this in blender 2.5

10
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:35,650
let's say I have the scene open

11
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:40,862
and I want to make sure Anti-Aliasing is on

12
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:45,835
well, I'm gonna just scroll down all the way to Anti-Aliasing

13
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:47,883
wow that took about a second

14
00:00:47,974 --> 00:00:49,738
but look how much faster it would be

15
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:56,360
if I could really quickly to close and open these little sections in the render panel

16
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:59,569
you can do that by hitting A

17
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,834
that just toggles them on

18
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:04,052
enough really simple

19
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,330
No.2: Math

20
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,838
apparently and maybe this is really obvious to anyone who has used this program

21
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:19,585
but you can do math in any field with their numbers in blender 

22
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,906
so you've got 100 here

23
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:24,535
you'll just type /2

24
00:01:24,523 --> 00:01:26,617
and it goes to 50

25
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,256
wow that is cool

26
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:31,089
now this is useful in a lot of situations

27
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:37,006
because if you're dealing with a technical things that have absolute values

28
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:41,399
so right here we've got this setup to be you know to render it 2000

29
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:43,777
what if you wanna render it in 4000

30
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:50,217
well normally I would come up with and launch the calculator

31
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:55,577
and do the math here that want it to be precise

32
00:01:55,634 --> 00:02:00,709
but you can actually just type in *2 on both of these values

33
00:02:00,732 --> 00:02:01,733
and there you go

34
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,713
beautiful

35
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:08,401
that applies basically everywhere in blender

36
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,529
No.3 Local View

37
00:02:10,552 --> 00:02:15,968
also a feather from years ago that I did not know about

38
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:25,140
so basically when you're dealing with scenes of any complexity you're working in a space with a lot of other things

39
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:28,645
hitting period to center my selection

40
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:36,872
and sometimes to be a drag if these things are included in your view and the only one is selection of our objects

41
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:41,173
let's say that I want to get all the lights just by themselves

42
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,039
and it's pretty easy

43
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:49,446
first of all to select all in the same type with Shift G -> Type

44
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,976
and then go into local view by hitting the / button

45
00:02:55,033 --> 00:03:00,609
Bam! Now all we see are lights

46
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:02,042
everything there was selected 

47
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:06,765
and in a point you can just start working with these things by themselves

48
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:10,395
you can toggle in and out with /

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,310
and you can move things away from local view by hitting M

50
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:17,427
pretty cool

51
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:23,287
that's concludes the first installment of blender tips with Colin Levy
