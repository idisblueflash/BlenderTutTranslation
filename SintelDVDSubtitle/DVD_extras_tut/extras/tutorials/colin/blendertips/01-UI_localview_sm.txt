Hello, this is Colin Levy

How are you

I thought I'll be interesting to do a series of really short and less than one-munite videos

to show you tips and tricks that I learned in blender during my time on Sintel

I thought I knew blender

but appearently there's a lot of people who know a lot of things that I didn't know

everything in this little series gonna be simple, really simple

so to jump right in

first I wanna show you this in blender 2.5

let's say I have the scene open

and I want to make sure Anti-Aliasing is on

well, I'm gonna just scroll down all the way to Anti-Aliasing

wow that took about a second

but look how much faster it would be

if I could really quickly to close and open these little sections in the render panel

you can do that by hitting A

that just toggles them on

enough

No.2: Math

appearently and maybe this is really obvious to anyone who has used this program

but you can do math in any field with their numbers in blender 

so you've got 100 here

you'll just type /2

and it goes to 50

wow that is cool

now this is useful in a lot of situations

because if you're dealing with a technical things that have absolute values

so right here we've got this setup to be you know to render it 2000

what if you wanna render it in 4000

well normally I would come up with and launch the calculator

and do the math here that want it to be precise

but you can actually just type in *2 on both of these values

and there you go

beautiful

that applies basicly everywhere in blender

No.3 Local View

also a feather from years ago that I did not know about

so basicly when you're dealing with scenes of any complexity you're working in a space with a lot of other things

hitting period to center my selection

and sometimes to be a drag if these things are included in your view and the only one is selection of our objects

let's say that I want to get all the lights just by themselves

and it's pretty easy

first of all to select all in the same type with Shift G -> Type

and then go into local view by hitting the / button

Bam! now all we see are lights

everything there was selected 

and in a point you can just start working with these things by themselves

you can toggle in and out with /

and you can move things away from local view by hitting M

pretty cool

that's concludes the first installment of blender tips with Colin Levy
