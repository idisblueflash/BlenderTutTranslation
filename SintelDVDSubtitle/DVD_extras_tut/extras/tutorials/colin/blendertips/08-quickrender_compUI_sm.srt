00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:02,243
So to this tutorial 

2
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:06,997
I'm gonna open up from the bamboo forest to talk for a time

3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:09,131
and I'm just gonna show you how I set it up

4
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:13,131
how I will go about rendering other versions of this

5
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:18,842
because for the files you are gonna be digging through of Durian

6
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:22,921
basically, and now, I'm just gonna open it and hit F12

7
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:27,487
the things that should probably be done to make the initial rendering list

8
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:28,632
to render it quicker

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,770
so you can at least see... What the thing looks like 

10
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:35,692
I'm just gonna go and turn the Simplify on

11
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:40,352
in the World settings there are the samples right there

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,658
and the Gather tab

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,639
24 would take a long time

14
00:00:45,686 --> 00:00:48,620
so I'm just gonna divide this by 4 or 6

15
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:50,832
I just do 6

16
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:53,484
it's a really low samples

17
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:57,045
and then we can go and turn of Anti-Aliasing

18
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:01,407
turn off Ray Tracing... Well, we can keep that on

19
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:05,800
and for SSS, I don't we need it really in this case

20
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:07,588
check the render resolution

21
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:09,110
1024 is fine

22
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,652
and then hit F12

23
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,648
and a lot of times

24
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:18,367
SSS, you know, it should a side effect anyway

25
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:23,764
so if you are trying to judge the lighting in the environment

26
00:01:23,764 --> 00:01:25,709
but you wanna see the character

27
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:30,753
you know, you can turn that off and do other things

28
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:33,444
just a bit of judges and renders quicker

29
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:34,542
so I just cut

30
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,743
when this render finishes and pick it up there

31
00:01:37,915 --> 00:01:39,437
so here we are

32
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:40,504
the render is finished

33
00:01:40,473 --> 00:01:41,932
and take about a minute and a half

34
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:46,654
so first let's put a view

35
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:53,024
and go into the node setup with Shift F3 to go to the Node view

36
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,366
and I'm just gonna change to the render compositing nodes

37
00:01:56,695 --> 00:02:01,402
so, first I wanna show you how....er..  I'm gonna do it in the backdrop

38
00:02:01,418 --> 00:02:03,332
you've probably known this

39
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,297
but, you know, a lot of time just there in the background

40
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:09,090
and you can get destructing it and you can turn it off

41
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,204
but to move it, you can go Alt MMB click and drag around

42
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:17,687
and a little bit more on the tricks than that is to scale it up and down

43
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:19,774
hit V

44
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:22,473
goes down, and back up

45
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:24,810
so it's kind of interesting

46
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:25,940
now another look

47
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:33,047
a quick thing I wanna show you is selecting the same type of node

48
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,973
for example

49
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:39,087
if you are not sure whether or not the focus is already on all of your render layers 

50
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:43,543
because usually it will make sense to be at least on right one

51
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:45,285
you can hit Shift G

52
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,418
it will select the same type of node

53
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:50,180
wherever your curves you are set up

54
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:54,118
so you can see all your RGB curves 

55
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,809
and you can even...er... If you got one selected

56
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:04,410
I think you can go to the next with Shift and bracket

57
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,496
so you can through toggles, through them

58
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:13,321
and then hit Home to view all

59
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:17,792
I thought that NumPad . Will take the center view 

60
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,707
but of course it's not

61
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:24,633
now if you want to place or add new node

62
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:25,888
a lot of times I do is

63
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:28,759
I'm working in real close like this

64
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:31,842
I wanna add, say, a Blur

65
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:36,172
and, wow, it just appeared away, down here

66
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:37,514
that's not where I wanted

67
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:39,224
and I have to move it all the way back

68
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:41,444
and as I was wondering why it was

69
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,652
Barton just told me all I have to do is click where I want it

70
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:46,935
then add a node

71
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,014
and it pops up where you want it

72
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,309
so I guess you are placing an invisible 2D cursor or kind of the thing

73
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:55,133
and, it's just a little thing

74
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,968
it's probably handy to know 

75
00:03:57,243 --> 00:04:00,545
last thing I wanna show you right at this moment is

76
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:05,080
if you go to the image viewer and just click around

77
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,076
you will get this really handy...

78
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,759
We have to be viewing the render result

79
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:17,623
you will get this handy XYZ or RGB values here

80
00:04:17,662 --> 00:04:19,851
so you can get some information about your image

81
00:04:19,945 --> 00:04:23,240
what's alpha is zero, or what's black, you know

82
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,758
also, you can see values for Z

83
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:29,249
but even cooler than that is

84
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:37,140
you hit P

85
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,745
be here you'll have a very formal vector scope pop-up

86
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,392
and these are really awesome tools

87
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:47,401
really looks good if you expand them to the maximum

88
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:49,260
we can get some nice detail

89
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:53,128
and you can see the distributional color

90
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,834
these are the professional looking tools 

91
00:04:57,795 --> 00:05:01,223
so you should definitely use P in the image area

92
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:04,471
OK, that concludes this portion

93
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:06,848
see you later

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
