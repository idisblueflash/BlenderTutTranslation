1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,605
OK, so I'd like to show you a couple of sequencer features for your quick

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,193
the first I just wanna do general file selection thing

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,414
so I'm gonna add an image sequence 

4
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:12,902
just can navigate to this tab

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,428
whatever the sequence

6
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:21,608
what you can do is, actually, let's say these PNGs are mixed in with tons of various kinds of files

7
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:25,939
you can add... Do a *.png

8
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:32,817
and you will automatically select all of the files of that extension

9
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:34,993
that's really handy

10
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:37,966
a little thing

11
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:43,531
now here right now is actually the correct aspect create issue

12
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:45,326
a lot of times you bring something in

13
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,121
and it's completely distorted

14
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:51,228
so my first step usually is after I've imported something 

15
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:54,571
to go to Strip -> Set Render Size

16
00:00:54,672 --> 00:00:56,254
and what that's gonna do is

17
00:00:56,187 --> 00:00:58,835
if you go to Shift F7

18
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:01,202
and look at dimensions

19
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:10,279
it's going to set the dimensions of the project to whatever that actually file is

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,803
so let's just say that comes in like this

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,683
I'm gonna go Strip -> Set Render Size

22
00:01:17,796 --> 00:01:19,602
and as soon as you change the frame

23
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:21,453
you will see that is just set correctly

24
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:24,752
so now I'm gonna open up the aminatic edit

25
00:01:24,853 --> 00:01:27,949
and just show you a really color balance stuff we are doing

26
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:31,001
and... gonna change the scene to ColorGrade

27
00:01:31,102 --> 00:01:31,697
as so

28
00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:33,851
these are referencing AVI files 

29
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,329
and basically there is a really cool addon

30
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:41,233
which allows you to take any property of the given strip

31
00:01:41,323 --> 00:01:47,572
and allow you to apply that same properties or values to other strips

32
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:55,875
and this is useful especially when you are doing color correction with the Color Balance tools here

33
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:59,577
they are pretty basic, but really nice to work with

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,937
and, so, let's just assume that I wanted to give this entire scene a really green fill

35
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:08,856
I wanna make it look like that 

36
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:13,377
by the way, you can use Shift to make this ultra sensitive 

37
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:17,495
what I'm going to do is going to the User Preference

38
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:19,133
Ctrl Alt U

39
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:21,938
and go to the Add-Ons pane

40
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,383
and I've already searched for "chart"

41
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:28,333
but we are looking indeed for the Property Chart

42
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:31,160
and you can just go ahead and enable it

43
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,077
and... (oops)

44
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,703
now at the bottom you would see the Property Chart

45
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,676
and it's already got all these properties enabled

46
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:41,695
the basic I would have done is

47
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:43,715
if I got this strip selected

48
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,702
use Color Balance

49
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:48,360
I can hover over a property like Lift

50
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:55,136
and take a look at with the Python line says "SequenceColorBalance.lift"

51
00:02:55,282 --> 00:03:01,486
and you can see here that I've got "Use_color_balance.lift"

52
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:02,956
"color_balance.gamma"

53
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:03,977
"color_balance.gain"

54
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:08,431
so these are properties that I've just basically copy and paste into here

55
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:12,437
and that becomes what the chart is

56
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:19,191
so let's just say I want... Let's go ahead and make this green as we've designed

57
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:20,885
excellent that's perfect

58
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:23,129
now I wanna apply that to the rest of the scene

59
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:29,457
you see, as soon as I selected, the chart increases to the selection

60
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:34,247
and color balance is not enabled on this strip

61
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,624
the first thing I wanna do is make that enabled

62
00:03:37,793 --> 00:03:40,037
now the gamma selection is changed

63
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,438
so this one his a slightly more green hue

64
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,188
and I'll just copy the gamma

65
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:49,528
so, right now, if you like this chart it's pretty normal

66
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,807
copy it over

67
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:56,675
and now the gamma is that green tint for the entire scene

68
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:58,942
that's pretty nifty

69
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:05,258
now if delete this actually right now I'm sure I'm having a bug with Property Chart

70
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,457
where it completely disappeared

71
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:15,210
but I could just say "color_saturation" I can just add that to the property chart

72
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:18,071
I'm undoing, so it doesn't disappeared

73
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:22,637
and say, I gonna type "color_saturation"

74
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:32,297
and I can see that saturation has replaced the color that we had before

75
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:35,068
so I can just make it completely this saturated

76
00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:38,389
border selected these guys, and apply

77
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:41,250
now, saturation is down to 0 for the entire thing

78
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:46,198
so it's a pretty handy tool which I thought you should know about

79
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:52,739
so yep, that's it for this subside of blender tips with Colin Levy
