1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,343
So I'm just gonna load up Sintel

2
00:00:02,331 --> 00:00:05,532
ans show you the coolest feature you've ever seen

3
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:06,792
But before that

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,053
I will show you Simplify

5
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:10,982
Simplify is in the Scene panel

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,804
And if you scroll to the bottom

7
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:17,443
You will see that what you can do by toggling on 

8
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:23,331
It limits the view port the number of subdivision levels you are showing

9
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:27,869
So you can actually play back animations in real time

10
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:32,780
When you sort of simplify your scene

11
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:35,177
So if you look at Sintel

12
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:38,330
You turn down the Child Particles here

13
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:41,384
it just makes everything a lot more responsive

14
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:42,295
alright

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,798
so the thing I actually may have said about 

16
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:45,969
that's really cool

17
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:49,165
but even cooler is 

18
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:51,407
I select Sintel's body

19
00:00:51,437 --> 00:00:53,259
going the Texture panel

20
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:58,218
And you will see one of the textures here is skin color

21
00:00:58,312 --> 00:01:01,247
when you working in 3D

22
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:05,229
a lot of time you realize: "OK, I wanna make this changes on the texture."

23
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:10,549
then you gotta go into, Nautilus or the finder...or, you know, Windows Explorer 

24
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:13,040
And navigate to where ever that texture is

25
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:15,117
To just open it

26
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:19,815
And this is a... You know, it takes time

27
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:27,898
now what we can do is just hover over this little file browser icon

28
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:30,495
and if you read the tool tip

29
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:35,832
it says "Hold Shift to open the file, Alt to browse containing directory"

30
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,229
How cool is that?

31
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:42,578
So, Alt click, the actual directory is just popped up

32
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:47,341
And Shift click, you'll actually get the image

33
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,619
Really really handy

34
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:50,897
I was so excited

35
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:52,856
Campbell, it's awesome

36
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:55,459
alright, on the Part 5.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
