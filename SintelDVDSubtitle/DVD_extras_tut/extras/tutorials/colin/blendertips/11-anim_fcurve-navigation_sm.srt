1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
So, I'd like to show you guys 

2
00:00:04,636 --> 00:00:08,979
Basically, have a look at the animation at one of our files

3
00:00:09,057 --> 00:00:11,659
And you can be really confusing

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,841
So, here opened a shot from the market scene "03.4b"

5
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:22,693
and this is what it looks like, fill it in this view and discover around

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,038
and track the cam

7
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:28,229
it's kind of collided

8
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:32,612
so I'm going to just turn on Only Render

9
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:35,722
so you can see what the shot is

10
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:40,143
so I'm just gonna put his view over here

11
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:43,019
and, so you got a 3D view added

12
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:45,523
and by going a Shift F6

13
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:49,769
and toggle on the Graph Editor

14
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:52,547
so as soon as you get there

15
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:55,305
you'll see one troop of vertical lines

16
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:57,555
and by pressing Shift and Middle mouse button

17
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:58,689
it's coming around

18
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:03,228
and see, yep, that's a lot here

19
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:08,256
and zoom in Ctrl + Middle Mouse or Mouse Wheel, anyway

20
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:09,371
there's a lot of stuff here

21
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:11,856
to full view of everything I'm now just gonna press Home

22
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:17,157
so, this is a lot of animation, and not all of it is even showing

23
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,603
but this is what the scene looks like

24
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,715
and if yo go over here

25
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,628
and press A, and then Numpad -

26
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:27,917
that collapse all the channels

27
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:30,715
now we can see, alright 

28
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:34,686
we are looking animation for these two extra Man and Woman

29
00:01:34,842 --> 00:01:38,559
the dragon, Sintel... No idea what that is

30
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:41,807
plus camera animation there are just a lot here

31
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:46,346
so we only wanna look at what are relevant to us

32
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:48,419
so let's focus on the baby dragon

33
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:50,982
I'm just gonna select baby dragon's rig

34
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:53,819
and you'll notice it's selected here, as well

35
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,188
and since it's selected here

36
00:01:55,286 --> 00:02:06,418
I could just press V, and that should isolate everything to just what isn't been checked or selected in the channels here

37
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:08,550
so I've got three things selected

38
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:11,250
and I hit V

39
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,363
very directly

40
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:22,753
that should change what channels are available

41
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:28,602
I guess it's not working because I don't actually have the individual channels selected

42
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:35,821
but any case, actually the best way to do this is to turn onto this mouse cursor icon

43
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:40,106
and the tool tip is "Only include channels relating to selected objects and data"

44
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:46,014
so, you probably don't wanna see...I'm gonna press ++++

45
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:50,357
then A to select everything, then V, and you will see

46
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:51,668
OK, this is whole scene

47
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:53,859
you probably don't wanna see all that once

48
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:59,043
so I'm gonna press this mouse cursor icon 

49
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:02,290
and that will do a really good job of everything is done

50
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:05,264
now you'll notice... I'll press Home here

51
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:07,064
actually there's nothing to show up

52
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:09,881
and this can be a bit of confusing 

53
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,598
but the thing is, right now, we are not in Pose Mode

54
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,535
so I don't have the access to channels

55
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:17,374
and the channels are not selected apparently

56
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:21,365
so here we can just go in the 3D view

57
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:26,197
to Pose Mode, I'm gonna just use a shortcut Ctrl Tab

58
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:28,505
but you can also here to go Pose Mode

59
00:03:28,623 --> 00:03:29,796
select all

60
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:35,255
and here we've got all of our channels

61
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:40,165
so these are all of the animation channels that have animations on them

62
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:41,632
wow, that's a lot

63
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,491
the tongue is animated

64
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,251
let's just go to the tongue

65
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:51,336
just select that channel, press V, everything else disappears

66
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:54,720
alright, so, it's not actually animated but their key frames are on it

67
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,576
the keys haven't to be identical

68
00:03:57,596 --> 00:03:59,630
but I'm gonna look at all of it

69
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:06,067
so, pressing A here, and V, to show or toggle these ability

70
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:13,462
those of tools that are used£¬ A + Plus or Minus£¬V

71
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,822
or you can border select these channels, press V again, Home

72
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:22,148
these are all things that are  critical to use

73
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:26,784
and be able to navigate in, and figure out what you're looking at in terms of the animation

74
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:31,714
so, right now, I'm just gonna look at the "root", press Home again

75
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:33,592
and these are the animation on ¡°root"

76
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:34,962
what about the hips?

77
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:47,032
OK. So, it's moving pretty linearally and then we've got this channel, which is "X Quaterion", umm, you know, some rotation there

78
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,334
to look at... to select a channel...

79
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:59,494
uh... ok, first, really awesome, you can select all the keys to left and right of the playhead

80
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:00,981
with Ctrl + Right Click

81
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:06,146
so, I'm clicking on the right side here, and left side here, really really handy

82
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,278
and it's also the same in the DopeSheet

83
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:12,915
to select a channel, let me see how I did this

84
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:20,662
Ctrl Alt, and it will select all the keys, or, basically all the channels of those keys

85
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:27,685
you can also use the L key to select a single vertical of that curve

86
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:31,128
and then you're gonna select the rest of those it's connected to

87
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:36,293
and then, to select all the keys that happen on the same frame

88
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:41,105
just use Alt + Right Click to select

89
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:50,339
I remember in 2.49 there was there was the key which toggled vertical lines which is really handy

90
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:53,665
and this, sort of, gets back to that functionality

91
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:56,326
anyway, hope that would be a little bit of useful

92
00:05:56,365 --> 00:06:00,316
while we are here, I'm just gonna show you really quickly on how to swap out the proxies

93
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:04,327
because, if you notice, I want you really note the left up here

94
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:07,633
and it's really chugging to play back

95
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:09,687
so, I'm gonna go back

96
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:13,248
first gonna turn Simplify to 0

97
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:17,454
play it back

98
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:18,667
so it does work better

99
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,345
but still, it's too slow

100
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:31,911
so what I'm actually gonna do, these are high resolution versions of the models we actually use in the rendering 

101
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:35,824
but I'm just gonna swap it out for what the animation that is actually I'm working with

102
00:06:35,902 --> 00:06:39,854
so I've got it selected, even through you can see, there is a Only Render

103
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:43,551
but I believe I didn't even have it selected

104
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,271
here we go. oops...

105
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:48,618
Dragon baby is selected

106
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:51,729
I wanna go over to the Object panel

107
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:54,272
and go down to Duplication

108
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,972
and you'll see "dragon_baby"

109
00:06:56,952 --> 00:06:59,339
now I'm gonna select in this group

110
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:02,665
you'll see that we already have only two options

111
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:05,580
that is because the libraries are already owning it up

112
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:09,218
but here, all I'm gonna do is just to "dragon_baby_simpl"

113
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:10,294
as you'll see this disappears

114
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:14,559
but if frame forward, it snaps into position

115
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:17,572
and I'll do the same with Sintel

116
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:19,313
select Sintel here

117
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,485
so it is what she looks like

118
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:22,698
if I got the frame

119
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,360
she's got inherent stuff

120
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,234
we go here, the Duplication -> sintel_simple

121
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:33,927
frame forward, you'll see this is much better

122
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:37,037
now if I turn on Only Render

123
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:41,615
Ah, hahaha...

124
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:46,956
We recently turned off renderability for these guys 

125
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:54,214
so, instead, I have to disable the rig layers

126
00:07:55,055 --> 00:08:01,257
but there you go, it's much faster, it's still only 15 frames / sec

127
00:08:01,257 --> 00:08:06,500
but instead, what layer this guy is on...

128
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:09,806
We don't need the extras

129
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:12,173
this guy is on this layer

130
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:14,227
so, start taking off layers, and....

131
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,066
There we go, we are playing in real time

132
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:27,256
so, hopefully that it is helpful in some way, and figuring out how to look at these files that being little overwhelmed

133
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:30,445
alright, see you in the next one.
