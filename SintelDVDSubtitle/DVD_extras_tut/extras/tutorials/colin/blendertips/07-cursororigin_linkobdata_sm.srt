00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,670
OK, welcome to Part 7

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,677
first thing I wanna show you is a really really simple 

3
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:12,015
and that is when you want to return you 3D cursor to the origin

4
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:13,836
it's just a shortcut

5
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:17,761
but I have the want to do this, you know, for many many times

6
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:23,399
and I usually end up zooming away and go in like this to say

7
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:25,800
and then say "Cursor to Grid" to snap it

8
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:27,919
and that's just stupid

9
00:00:27,983 --> 00:00:31,933
so what you can actually do is just go Shift C

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,948
and then your new cursor is on the origin

11
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:35,249
beautiful

12
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:39,572
alright, next thing I wanna show you is linkage

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,698
I guess it is also one of the pretty obvious things but I didn't know it

14
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:47,755
it's kinda convenient

15
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:51,960
I mean you probably find multiple cases where you wanna use this 

16
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:53,906
let's just say, for example

17
00:00:53,992 --> 00:01:00,602
I've got, you know, a camera with very specific, you know, lens size

18
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,817
and I want this camera and this camera to both have that lens size 

19
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:10,445
what we can do is, select the two, select the active

20
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:13,911
hit Ctrl L, make links to the object data

21
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:14,865
and Bam!

22
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:16,517
Now they are all linked

23
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:19,972
and have the same attributes

24
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:22,399
you can do the same thing here

25
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:27,536
and for some reason I didn't know how to do that

26
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,984
it's quite useful

27
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:39,002
now what I wanna do is show you... Hmm... My driver is not mountains

28
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:44,813
so this is the way for the next Blender tips of Colin Levy

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
