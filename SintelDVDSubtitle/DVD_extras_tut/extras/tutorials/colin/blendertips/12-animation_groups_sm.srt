00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,538
Hey there

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:07,546
so, I think this is gonna have to be the last video tutorial in the series

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,301
I'm currently in Savannah

4
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:13,564
and tomorrow, actually, I'm flying to Amsterdam for the premier of Sintel

5
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:17,632
very excited, but school has started

6
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:19,789
and my schedule is filling up

7
00:00:19,862 --> 00:00:22,897
I wasn't able to get too quite as much as I originally intended

8
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:26,974
but, I'm proud to see that you've made all the way through to No.12

9
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,524
and hopefully you found it useful

10
00:00:29,648 --> 00:00:32,580
so, in the last tutorial, I was talking about animation

11
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:36,431
just how to visualize, how to look at the animation data in their files

12
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:39,517
and because it can actually be pretty challenging

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:46,713
just to see what's going on, you know, and to work with animation data you want to start getting into a little bit more complex scenes

14
00:00:46,888 --> 00:00:49,263
and I wanna show you in this particular case

15
00:00:49,273 --> 00:00:51,947
something that a little bit more of a test case

16
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:54,342
because it's a definitely outliner

17
00:00:54,476 --> 00:00:58,481
here I've done the layout for the first scene

18
00:00:58,688 --> 00:01:00,226
the scene was cut 

19
00:01:00,257 --> 00:01:07,339
this is the original fight scene that is gonna start of the movie with three bandies and Sintel

20
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:14,400
another rig has been updated since it's so... A little bit being broken her header's like lowing a bit

21
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:17,394
but from this part, she survives

22
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:26,953
and if you notice the actual length of the animation of this file, the single file is 1 min and 50 sec

23
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:32,084
so a lot of work, a lot of animation in this one file

24
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:39,331
and it can be difficult to, when you're actually working, to make sense at all

25
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:45,989
one of the limitations of blender, or just something so inherent about the way that blender works is that:

26
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:50,294
actions are properties of the object 

27
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:55,652
so you can't have multiple objects in a single action

28
00:01:55,817 --> 00:02:00,463
and this, you know, became a issue that little bit with, for example,

29
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:05,882
sintel's here, and actually all the bandies, all the characters are in this scene has stuffs

30
00:02:05,944 --> 00:02:12,200
so, even a stuff changes his hands from one character to another

31
00:02:12,314 --> 00:02:17,878
and part of change of setting that up is to constant the rigging side of it

32
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,769
but the other is managing the animation

33
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:24,857
when you have apended who has the stuff 

34
00:02:24,888 --> 00:02:32,424
what would normally happen if you have this "Only include channels..." button selected

35
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:35,263
and if you are working on the bandie's body

36
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:36,698
you see the bandie's body

37
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:40,352
when you working on the stuff, you only see the stuff

38
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:43,222
and, really, these things should be working in concert

39
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:57,324
because they are completely intergrated in, you know, the overall animation of the scene that's of any worth

40
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:01,732
but, you know, I was going to a process, just setting keys and animating

41
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:03,394
just really loosely

42
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:10,806
and, so, because I was struggling with just organizing the animation

43
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:17,041
I talked to AG online, and he implemented a little feature that I thought it was pretty obscure

44
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:20,582
I mean I don't imagine it that too many people know about it

45
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:25,032
and it's a button right here, if you are in the Dopesheet

46
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:29,192
"Only include channels from Objects in the specified Group"

47
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:31,721
so this is basically animation groups

48
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:36,986
and you can specify any group to, sort of, filter

49
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:40,114
what you are looking at in the Dopesheet

50
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:42,715
so, if I select Sintel's rig here

51
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:46,483
and I go into the Object buttons

52
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:52,533
you'll see in the groups, right here, that she is in several groups

53
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:56,167
and this one....both of them have this prefix "AN"

54
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,531
which is I just used to specify

55
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,503
OK, this group isn't animation group

56
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:04,973
"AN_ALLchars", so it's just characters and no cameras

57
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:07,688
and here, it's just Sintel by herself

58
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:14,171
so let me just show you all the animation first in the whole scene

59
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,743
and, just gonna select everything I don't know any to do that

60
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:23,080
alright, so, do you like the Dopesheet?

61
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,422
Summarily you get it pretty dense

62
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:25,826
and I can just scroll it down

63
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:27,880
lots of objects in the scene

64
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:31,793
if I toggle a few of these down

65
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:36,593
you know, this is, was....

66
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:49,456
actually, I was animating hands with empties for certain uses: camera, root of Sintel...

67
00:04:49,518 --> 00:04:51,706
Let's see where are the bindies

68
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,411
anyway, I think you get the point

69
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:58,644
surely we have the bindies around here

70
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:06,242
"GEO-stuff" so you've got stuff separated from bandies' "jack_simple_proxy"

71
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:08,461
OK, so this is jack's animation

72
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:10,691
alright, so, it's not too bad

73
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:13,633
but, it's very easy to view overwhelmed 

74
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:18,537
you know, especially for scrolling to all the stuff and camera are binded in it

75
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:25,464
and, if you notice the channel for Sintel's root is all the way up here

76
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:31,616
yep, Sintel's actual proxy and hand channels are where on here

77
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:35,653
and currently, there isn't a way to disorder them, can't click and drag

78
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:47,514
so, navigating and moving, you know, blocks of animation,you know, became extremely difficult to figure it out how to do

79
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:49,961
you know, I was working with the layers and not get a thing

80
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:54,607
so instead of talking isolate things

81
00:05:54,576 --> 00:06:02,504
I'm gonna take use of groups, and use that to just help me

82
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:04,001
actually see what I'm doing 

83
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:06,447
so, I'm just gonna toggle this on

84
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,233
I probably got one of these groups selected

85
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:10,536
but I'm gonna change it to Sintel

86
00:06:10,783 --> 00:06:12,714
and then press Home

87
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:18,805
and now, our scene is animated, that I have determined is relevant to Sintel

88
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:24,761
so that includes Sintel's body, yep, here is all just the relevant animation

89
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:27,301
left hand, right hand, her weapon

90
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:38,223
and you know this is may not be as elegant as if all of these individual actions would actually one, unified

91
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:42,786
but for most purposes, it's already achieved that

92
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:47,586
and what next thing is I connected this boot of the view

93
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:53,770
and create another dopesheet with another group

94
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:57,641
so here let's look at "Smith"

95
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,267
"Simth" animation for example, currently

96
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:13,456
so we've got the root you're just translating his poses and stuff

97
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:18,473
and those are the three different objects needed animation

98
00:07:18,494 --> 00:07:21,343
and because all here, the dopesheet icons

99
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:29,685
sort of, move all three of the same time without having to rearrange my view and find, OK, where is everything

100
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,709
so, ya, that is all I really want to share with you

101
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:45,190
and, just because, you know, being very very helpful especially with the scene which got very complex very fast

102
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:49,918
Umm.. Ya, I guess that is it.

103
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:58,435
If you want to send me... Or if you have very specific features or things you'd like to see demoed

104
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:02,430
I'm interested to continue this kind of short tutorial as here is

105
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:05,651
Um, but ya, I hope I find it useful

106
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,840
thanks very much for watching, bye

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
