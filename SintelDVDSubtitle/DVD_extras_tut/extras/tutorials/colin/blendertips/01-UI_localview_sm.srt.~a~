Hello, this is Colin Levy

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,773
How are you

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'll be interesting to do a series of really short and less than one-munite videos

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
to show you tips and tricks that I learned in blender during my time on Sintel

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I knew blender

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
but appearently there's a lot of people who know a lot of things that I didn't know

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
everything in this little series gonna be simple, really simple

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
so to jump right in

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
first I wanna show you this in blender 2.5

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
let's say I have the scene open

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and I want to make sure Anti-Aliasing is on

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
well, I'm gonna just scroll down all the way to Anti-Aliasing

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
wow that took about a second

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
but look how much faster it would be

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
if I could really quickly to close and open these little sections in the render panel

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
you can do that by hitting A

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
that just toggles them on

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
enough

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.2: Math

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
appearently and maybe this is really obvious to anyone who has used this program

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
but you can do math in any field with their numbers in blender 

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
so you've got 100 here

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
you'll just type /2

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and it goes to 50

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
wow that is cool

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
now this is useful in a lot of situations

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
because if you're dealing with a technical things that have absolute values

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
so right here we've got this setup to be you know to render it 2000

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
what if you wanna render it in 4000

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
well normally I would come up with and launch the calculator

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and do the math here that want it to be precise

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
but you can actually just type in *2 on both of these values

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and there you go

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
beautiful

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
that applies basicly everywhere in blender

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.3 Local View

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
also a feather from years ago that I did not know about

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
so basicly when you're dealing with scenes of any complexity you're working in a space with a lot of other things

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
hitting period to center my selection

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and sometimes to be a drag if these things are included in your view and the only one is selection of our objects

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
let's say that I want to get all the lights just by themselves

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and it's pretty easy

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
first of all to select all in the same type with Shift G -> Type

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and then go into local view by hitting the / button

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bam! now all we see are lights

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
everything there was selected 

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and in a point you can just start working with these things by themselves

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
you can toggle in and out with /

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and you can move things away from local view by hitting M

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
pretty cool

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
that's concludes the first installment of blender tips with Colin Levy
