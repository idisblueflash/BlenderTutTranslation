1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:00,765
Already

2
00:00:00,757 --> 00:00:07,668
so, right now I gonna show you about the camera switching system that Campbell implemented for Durian

3
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:13,577
this, of course, as everything is subject to change as the most ideal system

4
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:16,244
but I found it's quite useful whereas here

5
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:17,696
you might want to know how to use it

6
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:21,664
so I've just opened up the cabin environment file

7
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:23,273
we've already got one camera

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,867
in here

9
00:00:25,064 --> 00:00:27,778
by the way, while we are here

10
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:32,780
you can select the camera by going to set Select menu -> Select Camera

11
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:34,816
so now I've got it actually selected

12
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:37,932
but I'm gonna open up the Timeline

13
00:00:38,177 --> 00:00:42,942
and the way that camera switching works is it's linked to markers

14
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:47,044
so I'm just gonna make a marker on frame 22

15
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:50,248
by hitting M with my mouse over the timeline

16
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:55,589
Now I'm going to create another camera

17
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:58,003
and just put it right in the middle of the scene

18
00:00:58,098 --> 00:01:00,472
rotate it somewhere

19
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:05,380
not really the way I've played with the camera scale up and down

20
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,232
just for case

21
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,835
now we've got two cameras in the scene

22
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:10,965
and one marker

23
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:14,374
so, to bind a camera to a marker

24
00:01:14,476 --> 00:01:15,809
and it is the process

25
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,308
you select the camera

26
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:21,048
you make it active by going in Ctrl 0

27
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:28,748
and in the View menu there is a menu item "Bind Camera to Markers"

28
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:30,602
so you've got this marker selected

29
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,152
and I just gotta do the shortcut Ctrl B

30
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:39,612
so now this camera is selected...er...active, that is

31
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:45,726
and you can tell whether it's active because this triangle above it is filled in

32
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:47,541
that is binded to that marder

33
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,452
now I'm gonna go forward to frame 95

34
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,440
hit M to add another marker

35
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:54,223
I'm gonna select this camera

36
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:56,945
go into with Ctrl NumPad 0 

37
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:01,347
and, with my mouse over the timeline, hit Ctrl B

38
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:07,635
alright, so it's a little bit of a workflow you'll get used to

39
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:10,744
but, now we just grab

40
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,024
you will see how it switches around

41
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:20,566
you can move the marker to change the frame which camera will switch

42
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,184
you can re-order them

43
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:23,501
you can name them

44
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:27,493
and another is done actually in a really hacking way

45
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:31,170
by going into Frame menu actually just clicking here

46
00:02:31,288 --> 00:02:33,032
"lalala..."

47
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,854
and... "shotA" like so

48
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:43,185
but this is how it's done for Durian, and it's really handy

49
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:48,195
I guess that's all we have yet for this one, thanks

50
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,404
er... a little addendum to that is

51
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:53,024
a little shortcut that compared that how it is useful

52
00:02:53,063 --> 00:03:02,491
and that is Ctrl clicking on any of these markers, because they are bound, will select that camera

53
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:06,822
this is just a nice and easy way to access cameras in your scene

54
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,826
and another little thing is

55
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:17,363
if you make it unrenderable by, I usually go, Ctrl H

56
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:21,331
then it would not actually switch

57
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:26,183
so it is still technically bound

58
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:28,439
but when you play around the shadowing or other stuff

59
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,625
sometimes you actually don't want it to switch

60
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:37,015
or if you just wanna see what this camera sees, you know, for beyond and set up moving the frame that you've got

61
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:37,907
and you've decided on

62
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:45,031
you can just temporarily disable that render ability of that camera and enable it again once you want

63
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:47,264
this switched to actual linker

64
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:50,727
so, yep.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
